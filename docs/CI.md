*The generated index file is pretty barebones, but it gets the job done*

It's common for Flutter apps to include a web demo for the `main` branch hosted on Github Pages, but this can also be done for every branch in your repo.
This involes three workflow files, one to deploy the Flutter web app, one to generate an index file, and one to cleanup for deleted branches.

## Prerequisites

This GitHub Pages setup requires the `#` url path strategy, so ensure it is not disabled for your web builds intended for GitHub Pages.
If it is disabled, the Navigator 2.0 subroutes will prevent GitHub Pages from resolving the correct app when refreshed.

## Workflow 1 - Deploy Flutter Web Branch Previews

This workflow file can be added to your `.github/workflows` directory, or integrated into your existing CI workflow.

```yaml
name: Deploy Branch Previews

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  deploy_web:
    name: Deploy Flutter Web to GitHub Pages
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install and set Flutter version
        uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          channel: "stable"
          flutter-version: "any"
          cache: true
          cache-key: "flutter-:os:-:channel:-:version:-:arch:-:hash:"
          cache-path: "${{ runner.tool_cache }}/flutter/:channel:-:version:-:arch:"
      - name: Get branch name
        id: branch-name
        uses: tj-actions/branch-names@v7.0.7
      - name: Build Web
        run: |
          flutter pub get
          flutter build web --release --web-renderer=canvaskit --base-href="/${{ github.event.repository.name }}/${{ steps.branch-name.outputs.current_branch }}/"
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages ðŸš€
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@releases/v4
        with:
          branch: gh-pages # The branch the action should deploy to.
          folder: build/web # The folder the action should deploy.
          target-folder: "${{ steps.branch-name.outputs.current_branch }}"
```

Write permissions need to be enabled for the workflow to write to GitHub Pages.

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
```

This job should be run on `push` for every branch in the repo. but it can also be restricted to only certain branches if you choose.

```yaml
on:
  push:
```

Once you've done the above, enable GitHub Pages for your repository and you can view your app at `gh_pages_url` + `branch_name`. However we aren't done yet, we still need to cleanup for deleted branches and create an index file to link to each branch preview.

## Workflow 2 - Generating the Index File

This workflow file should be added to your `.github/workflows` directory. It will create
a `README.md` file in the `gh-pages` branch that links to each branch preview deployed to GitHub Pages.

```yaml
name: gh_pages_readme

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - "gh-pages"

jobs:
  gh_pages_readme:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          ref: gh-pages
        # Delete README.md
      - name: Delete README.md
        run: rm -f README.md
        # get list of branches and generate links to each branch's subfolder in the README.md file
      - name: Generate README.md
        run: |
          echo "## Flutter Branch Web Previews" >> README.md
          echo "" >> README.md
          git branch -r | grep -v '\->' | grep -v 'origin/gh-pages' | while read remote; do
            if [ -d "${remote#origin/}" ]; then
              echo "- [${remote#origin/}](./${remote#origin/}/)" >> README.md
            fi
          done
      - name: Commit and push if changed
        run: |
          git config --global user.name 'GitHub Actions'
          git config --global user.email github-actions@github.com
          git add README.md
          git diff-index --quiet HEAD || git commit -m 'Update README.md'
          git push
```

## Workflow 3 - Deleted Branch Cleanup

Finally, we need to cleanup deleted branches from gh-pages, otherwise the repository size will grow indefinitely.
This workflow will run on branch deletions and remove the associated folder from gh-pages.

```yaml
name: gh-pages-cleanup
on: delete

jobs:
  cleanup:
    name: Cleanup gh-pages
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.ref_type == 'branch'
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          lfs: true
          ref: gh-pages
      - name: Get branch name
        id: branch-name
        uses: tj-actions/branch-names@v7.0.7
      - name: Remove deleted branch from gh-pages
        if: steps.branch-name.outputs.is_default == 'true'
        run: |
          git config user.name "Github Actions"
          git config user.email github-actions@github.com

          BASE_REF=$(printf "%q" "${{ github.event.ref }}")
          BASE_REF=${BASE_REF/refs\/heads\/}

          echo "Deleting folder: $BASE_REF"
          git rm -rf $BASE_REF
          git commit -m "Remove deleted branch $BASE_REF"
          git push
```

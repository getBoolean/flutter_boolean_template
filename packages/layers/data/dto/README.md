# DTOs (Entities)

This package is part of the data layer, which contains Entities (DTOs), Repositories, and Data Sources (e.g., API access) for the application.

## Entities

- These models should only be created by the `repository` package. Any models that require data validation
  should be created in the [domain](/packages/layers/domain/) package.
